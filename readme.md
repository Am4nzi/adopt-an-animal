# Save the Tokoloshe

"Save the Tokoloshe" is a fictional 'petition' website, urging users to sign a petition to give a non-existent mythical creature, the tokoloshe, protected status. It was completed in one week during my time at [SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/), where I studied from July - August 2019,
